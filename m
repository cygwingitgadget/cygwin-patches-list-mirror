Your copyright assignment has arrived and got signed, so I took the
opportunity to apply your patch.  Thanks.


Looking forward to see more patches,
Corinna


P.S.: Just a friendly reminder, you're all the time using "we" in the
context of this patch.  I've positively assumed now that this patch has
been created by yourself.  If other developers in your company want to
provide patches, please make sure they all have a copyright assignment
in place.  I do not like these legal hassles, but I have to follow them,
sorry.
