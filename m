FWIW, I'm very happy to see all of this regularized, as you are doing.

Can I ask you to also take a look at the utils.sgml file and update the
documentation there, too?  It should be self-explanatory.

If you feel like regularizing the presentation in this file so that all
of the options are displayed in the same way that would be an added
plus.
