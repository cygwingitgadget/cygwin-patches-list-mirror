Pierre or Corinna,
Have either of you considered adding code to cygcheck to check for more
common ntsec "problems"?  At the very least, something along the lines
of "your username isn't in /etc/passwd" seems like it would be
worthwhile.

I really would be thrilled if someone was interested in adding more
checks to cygcheck.  I think that cygcheck is starting show its age
these days.
