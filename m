No, I haven't.  I thought I didn't need it for small patches?  I must have
misunderstood the instructions.  I'll file one asap.

An unrelated question (and this should have been a separate message, but
since you quoted that part specifically): were the original attachments
filtered out because of the missing assignment?  Or is there some problem
with pine's base64 attachments?  I've seen other people use pine, which
was what confused me when my attachments didn't show up.
