I've regenerated this in the past but apparently my upgrade to RH Linux
7.3 left me with some docbook tools that don't like cygwin.  This has
always been an annoyance with our use of these tools.

I wonder if the sgml files are a barrier to entry for documentation
contributions.

Anyway, if you can regenerate these files, it would be appreciated,
David.
