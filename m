I had not expected you to take action on this issue so soon:

Actually, I think this is the wrong change. I'm sorry I came up with 
this confusion because I didn't test sufficiently, but as I said in my 
second mail

I think this is absolutely the right thing to generate - after all, what 
else should be expected here?
The "stray bytes" are created in bash/readline, the previous behavior of 
cygwin console in this case was perfect, I'd suggest to revert, please.
