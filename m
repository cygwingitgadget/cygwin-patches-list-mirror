I think you have done the right thing. You have taken the job and told about that there is an
error and that can't go in this way in future. Than I have send some note, how to make it
easier for you and other maintainers, because someone who is not involved in things has
another sight and this may help to make things easier especially for newbies like me. And
this help to avoid errors, because there so many information, which has to be keep in mind,
so that any reduction make contributing easier. :-)
