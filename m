I thought the OS was clear from the subject and the comment in the patch,
but here is more detail:

Microsoft Windows NT
4.00.1381

It should be NT 4 with all the latest windows update stuff patched.  But,
this is an SGI 320, and so subject to all kinds of possibly weird stuff.

Sorry, I really don't mean to be difficult.
