The preceding comment tries to explain why we always compare case
insensitive.  There's a high probability that the symlink will be used
by native (non-Cygwin) processes which are insensitive.

There's a twist here.  NTFS or ReFS or other filesystems (but not FAT)
are usually case sensitive.  It's the OS which makes them case insensitve
by using a specific flag at open time, combined with a kernel registry
key.  So apart from FAT, the creator of a file decides if it's created
sensitive or insensitive, and the one searching for and opening a file
is deciding if the search/open is sensitive or insensitive.

Also, we're creating the symlink via CreateSymbolicLinkW, which is
probably acting case insensitive anyway...

...unless the symlink is created in a case sensitive dir, I assume.

Right now we don't handle case sensitive dirs in the path_conv code.  We
only check for the kernel registry key and the FILE_CASE_SENSITIVE_SEARCH
filesystem flag.

To add the sensitive dirs to the picture, path_conv() would have to
check every directory on NTFS for
NtQueryInformationFile(FileCaseSensitiveInformation). It would then
set the path_conv::caseinsensitive flag accordingly.
