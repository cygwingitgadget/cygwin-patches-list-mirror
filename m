I hadn't considered it before but there doesn't seem any reason why I
shouldn't.  Thanks for the suggestion: it'll avoid quite a bit of
messing about for me.

I assume that the usual conditions apply, i.e. I need clearance for
changes to non-cygserver files.  BTW I've been treating all the System V
IPC files (both in the cygserver code and in the DLL) as "cygserver"
files: I hope that's alright.

Cheers,

// Conrad
