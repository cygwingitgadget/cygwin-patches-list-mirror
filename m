  The only way I'm used to building it is as a standalone checkout, and in my
case natively, although I know that cgf and corinna generally cross-build it
from linux, using I think a ming (rather than cyg) cross-compiler, and
presumably by passing it as CC/CXX_FOR_TARGET at configure time.  I believe
it's meant to build in a combined-tree setup, but I haven't tried it myself.

  So, yeah, config/ is OK, it comes with that and a set of top-level files,
see CVSROOT/modules for the full list.

  I'm sure that's all the result of historical inadvertency rather than any
grand design!  Let's see if we can't fix it.  I'm going to check out a clean
copy and try autoreconfing it with new tools.

    cheers,
