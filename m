Max,

A quick response off topic for the other off-topics.  Have you looked at 
Virtual-Access (Think VA6 you helped me with).  I have been using for a long 
time (when it was still bought software) and it just went Open Source.  I 
haven't been brave enough to use the alpha version of the Open Source Version 
yet.  Handles mail, newsgroups, threading....
