Nevermind.  It doesn't work the way I remembered.  The while loop which
decrements sigtodo only executes once when it encounters a normal UNIX
signal (it probably should just be recoded as an if).  So, this should
be a non-issue.  In fact, I don't see how multiple signals coming in at
the same time would have the effect you mentioned either.
