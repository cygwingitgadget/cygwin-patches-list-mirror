Wow.  Do i have to suffer with this tcl crap in YA cygwin mailing list?

If you want to submit patches for tcl/tk, use the insight mailing list.

This would not be the correct place for this patch even if there wasn't
a more appropriate place that I have mentioned 127 times already.

Mumit, you were once a valued contributor to the project but that doesn't
give you a grandfather clause for sending off-topic posts to cygwin-patches.

Use the appropriate mailing list, please.
