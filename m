Apologies to anyone who has tried to send email to the cygwin lists and
gotten a "local subject" bounce.  This was supposed to only kick in when
a keyword in the subject matched a list of blocked keywords but the
regex match was screwed up.  So a few valid messages (like John
Morrison's recent mail to cygwin-apps) were blocked.

I think I have the problem fixed now.  I don't really understand why it
wasn't blocking everything.  If it had been doing that I would have
noticed much sooner.

Sorry for any inconvenience.
