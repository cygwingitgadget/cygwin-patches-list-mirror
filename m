I know it's amazingly late to be responding to this but I'd like to reconsider
it, although I'm not wild about the 'cygtweak' name.

Maybe cygoption would be better?  And, if you're still interested in submitting
this (and I wouldn't blame you if you weren't given that it's been more than
a year) we'd need this to be added to the utils.sgml file, also.
