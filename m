We just have no feedback from the person who's collecting the papers so far.
For that reason we have to wait, yet.

We'll wait for the next patch.  In the meantime, please reread the
http://cygwin.com/contrib.html page, especially the part under
"When you have finalized your changes".  Send the ChangeLog as
plain text, the actual patch as unified diff.  In clear text,
not uuencoded or zipped.  Be sure to use correct formatting, in the
source code as well as in the ChangeLog.  It will help to avoid
frustration on both sides :-)
