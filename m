Btw, I am wondering a few things about these patches.

1) Does Ron Parker have an assignment on file with Red Hat?  I can't
find one, if so.  This will be a requirement if the patches are
accepted.  The mechanical change that was just checked in is ok but
any more substantial changes will need an assignment.

2) Why is one of the files you're submitting copyrighted to Robert Collins
and Ron Parker?  What's up with that?  Technically, I suppose I shouldn't
even be looking at the file.  I guess it's lucky that I only had time
to look at the copyright statement.
