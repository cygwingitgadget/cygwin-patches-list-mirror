Thanks for patching the dates for me and sorry for the bother.

I just followed the example of one of the previous merges that I found
in the archives, but I did wonder whether I'd done the right thing with
the ChangeLog (I just copied across all the entries from the branch w/o
altering them).  I'll go through it some point in the next couple of
days and see if I can slim it down to better reflect the final result,
since there certainly was quite a lot of churn at one point. I'll aim to
do more frequent merges in future now that I've got the hang of it; that
should make the process rather easier too.

Cheers,

// Conrad
