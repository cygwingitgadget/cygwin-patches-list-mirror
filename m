Not necessarily. GetFileAttributes behavior is not defined for pipe paths. 
So it cannot be called on those paths. I believe it returns -1 on my XP 
system - after it opens and closes the pipe, changing the semantics for the 
server! But there's no guarantee what it would return on other systems.

What we're up against here is a failing of the Win32 API:
1) GetFileAttributes cannot be called on a pipe path.
2) There is no function that can tell you that a path is a pipe path unless 
you actually open it and use GetFileType - which changes server semantics.
3) Therefore, you have to detect pipe paths and avoid calling 
GetFileAttributes.

The problem with not at least somewhat supporting stat is that all of the 
common GNU command-line utilities (cat, etc.) have special code that depends 
on stat to check for multiple input files referencing the same physical 
file.

The behavior of one end of the pipe is close enough. The main differences 
between Win32 pipes and POSIX pipes is how they're created and how the 
different ends interact together (POSIX pipes blocking on open). But if an 
application is just using one end of a pipe (i.e., it was passed a pipe name 
as a file name), the behavior between Win32 pipes and POSIX pipes should be 
close enough to work. At least, I don't know of a way an application would 
fail.
