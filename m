cygwin-patches: a list for submitting patches to the Cygwin DLL and the
other components of the "winsup" directory (if you aren't sure what this
means, then you shouldn't be sending email here). Discussions of
supplied patches are also acceptable, of course. Only subscribers may
submit email to this list.
