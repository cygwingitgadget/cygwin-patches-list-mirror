With the toolchain available and Cygwin build passing and tests running, the community can further contribute to the project while having CI checks to compare with.

They are surely incorrect in a sense of the full signals handling implementations as they are just relocating to the target symbol. I was going to submit them as a separate patches to open discussion whether such temporary implementations could be accepted. Nevertheless, IMO it's better to keep them as separate commits in the history. The full-features signals implementation is in progress but it will take some time to finish and it's actually not needed to bootstrap the cross-compilers and get some baseline test results.

Thanks for the explanation.  I pushed your patch.

Looking forward to more :)


Thanks,
