Darn, it looked generated but I only looked around htdocs for sources.
Resubmitting against original winsup/doc/ source, which was much easier to edit.

+  <answer>
+    <para>Some ancient Cygwin releases asked users to report problems that were
+      difficult to diagnose to the mailing list with the message:</para>
+
+    <screen>find_fast_cwd: WARNING: Couldn't compute FAST_CWD pointer. Please report
+    this problem to the public mailing list cygwin@cygwin.com</screen>
+
+    <para>These problems were fixed long ago in updated Cygwin releases.</para>
+    <para>Unfortunately some projects and products still distribute these ancient
+	Cygwin releases, which do not support newer Windows releases, rather than
+	having their product install the current Cygwin release over the Internet.
+	They also provide no information about keeping Cygwin up to date with
+	upgrades and fixes.</para>
+    <para>The fix is simply downloading and running Cygwin Setup, using the
+	instructions at: 
+	<ulink url="https://cygwin.com/cygwin-ug-net/setup-net.html">
+	    setup-net.html</ulink>.</para>
+    <para>When running Setup, you should not change most of the values
+	presented, just select the <strong>Next</strong> button in most cases,
+	as you already have a Cygwin release installed and only want to upgrade
+	your current installation.  You should make your own selection if the
+	internet connection to your system requires a proxy, and to pick the
+	nearest up to date Cygwin download (mirror) site to your system for
+	faster downloads.</para>
+    <para>Cygwin Setup will download and apply updates to all packages required
+	for Cygwin itself and installed applications.
+	Any problems with applying updates or the application after updates should be
+	reported to the project or product vendor for follow up action.</para>
