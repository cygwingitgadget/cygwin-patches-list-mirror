In order for focus to be able to reach the group of radio buttons, one
must be selected. I chose what I thought would be the most commonly used
selections, and the most compatible across all the platforms.

The worst case scenario is that now the user will change the from
the default selection, which is on par with being forced to select in the
first place. The difference being now they'll be able to change the
selection with the keyboard via the accelerators, or changing focus.
