Eh, I was unsure if submitter or reviewer provides this.  Submitter it is.

In this specific case <stdio.h> includes <sys/cdefs.h>.  I figure one can't depend 
on what's included, or in what order.  So as Brian suggested, I've added an 
"#include <sys/cdefs.h>".  Not every site of __inline within the Cygwin source 
tree does this; I guess those will be fixed if/when reported as a problem.

v2 patch for 3.4.7 is on its way in.  If it's OK I'll then submit it for 3.3.6.
Thanks all for the review comments,
