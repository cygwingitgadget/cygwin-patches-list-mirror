I hope you'll find my ones acceptable!.

Seriously, the guidelines are guidelines. Being 100% correct isn't the
issue - it just happened that your particular changelog was visibly
incorrect. Dont' worry - I'm equally pedantic with most other
contributors. I don't _like_ being so because it raises the barrier to
contribution.

However, as your patch was for w32api which I am not a regular committer
to, I had a responsibility to Danny Smith and the other w32api folk to
'keep the standard up'.
