I'm not clear here.  I just checked my records and I've never been
notified that you have submitted an copyright assignment.  However, I
know that you've been involved with Cygwin for some time so maybe this
predates the time where I was paying attention to such things.

Do you think you've already sent one of these in -- maybe to Geoff Noer?
