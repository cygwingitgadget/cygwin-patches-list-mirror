Thank you for these Elfyn.  Applied with just a few minor changes.

Sorry for being so far behind.  I'm trying to catch up now.

If anyone has patches against winsup/doc/*.texinfo files for me, send
them here (cygwin-patches) and I'll try to get to them at least once a
week.

It will be *quite* some time before I am able to wade through the main
cygwin list and discover things for the FAQ on my own.  But I should
be able to apply patches on a fairly regular and timely basis, at
least for a while.

Thanks for your patience and understanding.

Regards,
David
