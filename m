Subject: setup.exe 2.53 fails when fetching source

When I try to fetch the latest bash source using the setup.exe I just built
from the CVS tree, it aborts with a Dr Watson dump.  I haven't seen this
happen downloading binary packages.

Is it happening to anyone else?

I'm running under WinNT 4.0 SP4 and built the setup.exe from a CVS update I
just completed a few minutes ago.  I have downloaded and installed all
Cygwin packages except Postgresql using setup.exe.
