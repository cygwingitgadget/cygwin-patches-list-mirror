I've gotten a copy of Thomas's assignment (it was a personal assignment so
I assume that he does not have an employer who could claim his work) so I'm
happy to let his patches in.

Thomas, please still send your paperwork via snail mail, too.  I apologize for
the inconvenience but at least we do send you a valuable prize (tm) for your
effort.  I think it's either a tee shirt or a coffee mug...
