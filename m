Hello, there! :)

I have one of those quick questions :)

At the end of the copyright assignment form there is the following:

Agreed:  [signature]                    Date [Write the month with LETTERS]:


For Red Hat,

[signature]


Obviously I should sign on "Agreed", but who is to sign under "For Red
Hat" part ?
