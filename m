Yes, that's the Cygwin project, not the distro as a whole.  All packages
in the distro have their own license.  THe above is strictly only about
the Cygwin project license as defined by ...

After Red Hat stopped selling the Cygwin buyout license, Red Hat changed
the license of the DLL to "GPLv3+ w/ linking exception" and handed the
copyright over to the community, so the copyright holders are the
individual contributors, most of which are mentioned in
https://cygwin.com/git/?p=newlib-cygwin.git;a=blob;f=winsup/CONTRIBUTORS

The former buyout licenses had a pretty long lifetime, so it was
necessary from a legal perspective, that contributors passed over the
code under a BSD-2-clause license as long as the buyout licenses were
active.  This time has passed in the meantime, so we don't really need
the CONTRIBUTORS file anymore.

> "Cygwin authors" collectively?

The project doesn't "belong" anybody anymore.  The project has copyright
holders.  Those are the developers contributing code to the project
collectively.
