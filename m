This is why they are provided in fenv.h.  fenv-fp.h seems to be the internal header that is used for code that will create the non-inlined versions; the header file fenv-fp.h isn't exported from the library though (it's only used while building it), so anything defined there will never be inlined into user code.

There's another possibility for what is going wrong here: that on cygwin 
we're somehow picking up the wrong implementation of sys/fenv.h.  For 
example there's a version in libc/include/sys that lacks the inline 
versions of functions that libc/machine/aarch64/sys provides.  If that 
is the case, it might simply be that cygwin is not being configured 
correctly to find the aarch64-specific headers.

I think it would be instructive to look at the pre-processed source of 
fenv.c to see exactly which headers are being used.
