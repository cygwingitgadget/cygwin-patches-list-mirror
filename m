Sorry for disturbing you guys. But for the sake of saving all newbies from
my troubles, should we state clearly the requirements of ChangeLog? To say
the truth, I am still a little puzzled. The GNU ChangeLog Standards page
quoted on http://cygwin.com/contrib.html does not use any indentation at
all. And when I browse the ChangeLog on the Cygwin site, I found entries
with both indentation and not -- the problem with Web page, say,
http://sources.redhat.com/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/src/winsup/cygwin/ChangeLog?cvsroot=src,
but not the ChangeLog itself. But it is still confusing.

And it seems my current mailer does not support inserting TABs.    :-(
Maybe I need to use others when submitting a patch.

Best regards,

Wu Yongwei
