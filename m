Yes, I am.  I already understood all that you wrote below.

You snipped the winking smiley and accompanying statement that followed,
which was written upon realizing that the statements above might not be
taken the way I intended.

It boils down to simply...

I knew that, still only had a vague bug, and didn't have time to clarify
it.  I'm perfectly capable of doing that myself, so I don't bother with
sending in vague bug reports unless I feel the issue is critically in
need of a heads up.

Seeing Pierre's fix solidified this vague bug in my head, and I simply
wanted to thank him for fixing it.  Doesn't seem too perplexing to me.

For me, it was firmly 1, not all three.

The only part I object to is being indirectly criticized for saying thank
you.
