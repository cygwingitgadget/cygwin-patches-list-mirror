I'm a sysadmin (of a couple of sites) but I certainly don't have errnos
or Windows error number memorized.  I'm much more likely to be able to
help if someone reads me the text than if someone tells me a number.

Text is much less likely to suffer from dyslexic problems, too.

And, as I mentioned, including the number is unlike any other utility
in winsup/utils and any normal unix utility.
