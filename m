When I started over as FAQ maintainer (sheesh -- *years* ago?) I was
told that Changelog entries were not necessary for documentation, as
long as the cvs commit messages were informative.  (Perhaps this was
only intended for the FAQ, and not the other documentation, I don't
know.)  Occasionally, someone will add a Changelog entry anyway.
Hopefully this is out of habit, rather than to suggest a change in
policy.

I hope the policy hasn't changed, because I'm happy not maintaining a
Changelog for the FAQ texinfo source, and I agree with the original
opinion that it isn't necessary.

Best wishes,
David
