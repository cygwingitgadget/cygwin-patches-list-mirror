Thanks for that patch.  It actually looks good.  However, I couldn't
apply it.  Both of your attachments are malformed due to illegal
line breaks.  Please resend them.  Oh, and your ChangeLog is also
malformed.  The first line (date, name, mail address) is splitted
into two lines, the following lines are missing the indentation
(one tab).
