Hi,

I ran into the problem that's described in Chris Faylor's year-old email ht=
tp://www.cygwin.com/ml/cygwin-patches/2003-q3/msg00017.html. I'm getting an=
 error on my Windows2003 system running cygwin-1.5.11 with procps-010801-2:

$ uptime
Unknown HZ value! (500) Assume 100.
 18:18:29 up 7 days, 22:42,  0 users,  load average: 0.00, 0.00, 0.00


I don't have a cygwin build environment set up and was wondering whether so=
meone has a patched procps-010801-2 executable tarball or if could point me=
 to where I could download one.

Thanks very much in advance.

Eli Lauris
