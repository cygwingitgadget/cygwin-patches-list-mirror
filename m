That's a completely different piece of information than what you want 
Cygwin to show.

Knowing which package that thing came from has essentially nothing to do 
with what its interpretation as a symlink would look like.  Apples and 
Oranges.

And that very page tells me, in a big "Notice" blurb:

I notice no such thing right now, running the currently available 
release version 3.1.7:

stat: cannot stat '//wsl$/Debian/home/hbbro/link_to_a': Input/output error

[other commands that want to show more than just the name behave 
equivalently]

Links made by WSL directly on a Windows filesystem are understood by 
Cygwin.  But that's because WSL uses Windows symlinks in that case.

Microsoft could almost certainly just have used a symlink to implement 
this rather trivial feature.  But for some reason they apparently didn't 
care to explain anywhere, they chose to wildly overcomplicate it, 
inventing a completly type of reparse point.  So for what it's worth, 
that thing _is_not_a_symlink_.  Pretending it is one is bound to cause 
more problems than it solves.

All conclusions based on a single example are wrong.
