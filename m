You're perfectly welcome.  If you are going to offer gratuitous
criticisms you can expect my opinions of your criticisms to be
forthcoming.

You actually made some good points in your response. They were good enough
that you didn't need to slam anyone with your asinine observation.

I certainly stated my case too strongly here.  I'm certainly open to
criticism if I can discern a modicum of conscious thought behind the
criticism.  Sadly, that was lacking in this case.

Would you rather that I just make unilateral decisions rather than
discuss things?  My first impulse was to just ignore the patch so
that would not have been to your advantage.

Or would you prefer that if I see a patch that troubles me in some way,
I should just check it in automatically?  Maybe that is not a big deal
since patches are so few and far between and cygwin suffers from a
surfeit of opinions over deeds.

Since I had no strong opinion (or actually a slightly negative opinion),
I asked for votes on whether the patch was worthwhile.  So far the votes
are 2-1 in favor of the patch.  It looks likely that it will be included.

If it isn't being included fast enough to suit you then...  Gee, I guess
I just don't care.
