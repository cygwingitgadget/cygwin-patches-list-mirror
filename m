Of course.

Cygwin 1.3.9 is the DLL version number.  It has no bearing on RCS.  If
you don't have RCS on your system, you need to run setup.exe again and
select it for installation.  It doesn't happen automatically.

I've redirected this query to cygwin@cygwin.com.  Please confine
responses to that mailing list.  This doesn't belong on cygwin-patches.
