Ok, Chris, whats the guideline in nuber-of-line before we need an
assignment? Do I need to back out this patch (it's very few lines, just
spread over a few functions).

Likewise for the others in the queue. I can wait until Thomas's
assignment reaches you (which will delay 1.3.11) or I could review and
commit (perhaps if Thomas faxed a copy to you ahead of the letter
arriving?)
