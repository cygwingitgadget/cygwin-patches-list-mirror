Dunno if I'm speaking for Chris here, too, but I usually send patches to
other lists without the date/name/email header, for the simple reason
that the date will change anyway to the date of checkin.  The name and
email address is given in the mail header anyway, so why bother?

As for quoting Jerry's email address again, I'm sorry that I didn't
notice that, but I was actually talking about quoting *my* email address
in the reply.  Just because this very email address is basically
/dev/null doesn't mean that we shouldn't care, IMHO.
