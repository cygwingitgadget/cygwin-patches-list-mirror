Sorry, I've been sidetracked for a bit.  I can agree with Ken too.  The only 
circumstance I could think of where multiple internal format support might be 
useful (to non-developers) was some user hanging on to an older Cygwin because it 
was needed to support something else (s/w or h/w) old and non-upgradeable. 
Doesn't seem very likely at this point.

I'll try to get the v2 patch out over this weekend.  Same end-result for same 
environments as the v1 patch, but incorporating all the comments I received.

To that end, does Jon's suggestion of /usr/include/sys/cygwin.h seem like the best 
location to define struct cygcb_t for use by both Cygwin and cygutils package?
Thanks much,

..mark
