I changed my email configuration in December and that resulted in some
sourceware.org mailing lists not thinking I was subscribed.  So some of
my timely responses to messages here are showing up here in an untimely
manner.

I noticed this when Corinna made the same observation that I thought I
had and then realized that my messages had never shown up.

FYI.
