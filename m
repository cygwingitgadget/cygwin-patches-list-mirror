For future reference here is what happens in Jason's experiments.
All of them start in the system service environment and do as follows

A) [optional] call gethostname to initialize wsock
B) setgid/setgroups/setuid to remove 544 from the token
   problem does not occur if 544 stays. Problem occurs even with
   545 (Users), so it's unlikely to a be a file/registry access issue.
C) create socket and call dup (using WSADuplicateSocket method).

There are 4 cases. 
Note that in case 2) the problem occurs before the dup.

1) A absent. Call directly from Windows 
   WSADuplicateSocket fails 10022 WSAEINVAL Invalid argument. 
   "Some invalid argument was supplied. In some instances, it 
   also refers to the current state of the socketÂ—for instance,
   calling accept on a socket that is not listening."

2) A absent. Call through sh -c (doesn't matter if sh initializes wsock)
   socket fails 10106 

   net helpmsg 10106
   "The requested service provider could not be loaded or initialized."

   fgrep 10106 /usr/include/w32api/winerror.h 
    #define WSAEPROVIDERFAILEDINIT 10106L
   WSAPROVIDERFAILEDINIT
   OS dependent 
   Unable to initialize a service provider. 
   "Either a service provider's DLL could not be loaded (LoadLibrary failed)
   or the provider's WSPStartup/NSPStartup function failed."

3) A present. Call directly from Windows
   Everything OK

4) A present. Call through sh -c (doesn't matter if sh initializes wsock)
   WSADuplicateSocket fails 10022

Uh.. Do you have a pointer to that? I am only aware of such problems when
sockets are duplicated across processes (by fork).
