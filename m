From my own build of setup 2.38, it would not let me select any source at
all.   And when I selected experimental, I was not able to see a package
that was visible/available in current.

IMHO this behaviour is different from setup 2.37 and 2.29, but then again, I
only had quick look when updating ghostscript..........
