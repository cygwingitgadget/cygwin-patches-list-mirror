Robert,

I am a doctor of philosophy, not a medical doctor, so I think I can be
forgiven a little typo and a (humorous) attempt at self-diagnosis. :-)
FWIW, even though I spelled it wrong, schizophrenia does involve a
fragmentation of the personality.  And now let's please stop this thread
before it drifts any more off-topic (if such is possible).

I will, of course, accept any constructive comments on the patch and/or
alternative implementations.
	Igor
