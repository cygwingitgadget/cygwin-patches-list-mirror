I applied the change already an hour before your mail from yesterday.
It makes a lot of sense to subscribe to the cygwin-cvs mailing list,
since you see immediately what has happened in the repository.

Well, it wasn't exactly a super-duper change, rather something I thought
of as a bugfix.

I was just going to refuse your request, when I had this really spooky
idea of actually *testing* this in an xterm running under Linux.  And,
what shall I say?  Xterm creates the same ESC 0xc3 0xb6 sequence when
pressing Alt-รถ.  I'll revert the change.  Note to self: "Testing doesn't
hurt".
