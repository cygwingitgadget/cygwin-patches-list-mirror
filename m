I have said clearly that the Web pages do not always have indentation. The ChangeLog FILE is OK.
You are completely right about that, but what I said was that it is CONFUSING. And the quoted
"GNU ChangeLog Standards" do not use indentation, either. Am I not clear enough?

And do you assume everybody has the complete Cygwin source files at hand? Sorry but I don't. I
even can't since I am behind a firewall and can only access the most current files by Web.

And I think it is better to have a more complete patch-writing guidelines than to correct me
again and again. Telling people to "model" just ain't enough. Better documentation and/or
training will do. I have seen enough programmers fail to model good examples.

I will use Netscape instead of Outlook Express when submitting a patch. Again, except for your
previous message I see nowhere mentioning the TABs.

Best regards,

No, you do not find any unindented entries in the ChangeLog.
