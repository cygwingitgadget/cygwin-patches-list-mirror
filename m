Ralf, I've checked this in.

However: Your changelog was atrocious.

The changes are meant to be 'proper' sentences. That means
capitalisation is important, as is spelling.

Next time I'll reject the patch and get you to fix it up. That wastes
time (yours) though, so I'd really prefer it if the changelog is
acceptable first time round.

Rob
