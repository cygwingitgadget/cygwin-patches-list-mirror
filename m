I should have that thick skin as well but I'm still not able
to not interpret directness as harshness sometimes. English
speaking/writing is somewhat more direct than German. I had
some collisions with Chris for that reason back in 1998. He
never wanted to be harsh but I didn't get that. Dependent of
my mood I'm sometimes still annoyed by this directness so I
feel the need to apologize when I was, uhm, direct, you know?
