Two problems:

1) Wrong mailing list.  I don't see a patch here anywhere.

2) The bar is a little higher on cygwin-*@cygwin.com mailing lists.  It's
   sort of expected that you will be willing to do a little bit of debugging
   on problems, not just raise the problems and hope someone else will
   do the debugging.

If you want to just report a bug then use the cygwin@cygwin.com mailing list.
