You both have a point.  There are two or more problems with the section.
For instance, it contains entries like bcmp, bcopy, bzero, which, yes,
have been deprecated from POSIX, but are actually 4.3BSD functions.
So those would have to be moved to the std-bsd section.

Just as gethostbyaddr, gethostbyname, ftime, etc.

cuserid was System V.

ecvt/fcvt/gcvt are old as dirt, probably System 7.

on_exit is SunOS, so why the heck did I add it to the std-deprec
section 10 years ago?

ETC

So, is there really any of them, which have been first added as part of
the POSIX standard and then have been deprecated again, or were all of
them part of an older or different OS?  If so, the expression
"deprecated" wouldn't make much sense, and the section would only
contain a few SVID functions and the really exotic stuff like

  clock_setres                (QNX, VxWorks)
  pthread_getsequence_np      (Tru64)
  gethostbyname2              (first defined in BIND 4.9.4)
