hi all,

i have the same problem with the cygwin install spawning 1000s of 
processes on win x64 reported in a post on 28 july ..

i did not see anybody responding with a fix or a workaround
does anybody have an idea how to get cygwin up and running on win x64 ?

or better yet how to compile it for win x64 ?
i did download the source code .. but it seems to require unix tools 
(like configure) to get it to compile ???


thanks

frank
