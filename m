If you are employed as a programmer, most companies have you sign some
kind of form saying that your work belongs to them.  If the form can,
in any way, be construed as covering cygwin patches then your employer
needs to be involved.

Or, to put it another way, if you sign a form, indicating that you own
the rights to your changes, and your employer disagrees and comes after
Red Hat for the changes, guess who's going to be in hot water?
