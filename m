Sorry for the delay.  I've committed your patch.

I trimmed down your ChangeLog entry since ChangeLogs are supposed to be
a fairly terse description of what changed.

Thanks for taking the time to go through the approval process and for
producing this patch.  I also appreciate very much that you took the time to
change the documentation.
