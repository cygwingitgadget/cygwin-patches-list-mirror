The definitive answer for what the mailing lists are used for is:

http://cygwin.com/lists.html .

The description of cygwin-patches is this:

cygwin-patches: a list for submitting patches to the Cygwin DLL and the
other components of the "winsup" directory (if you aren't sure what this
means, then you shouldn't be sending email here).  Discussions of
supplied patches are also acceptable, of course.  Only subscribers may
submit email to this list.

Since your email did not include a patch or discussion of a patch, I
guess you can draw your own conclusion.
