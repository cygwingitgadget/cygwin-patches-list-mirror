Well, the variable IS a global, shared by exceptions.cc and pinfo.cc,
and explicitly stated to be global in the ChangeLog:

2005-09-19  Christopher Faylor

        * exceptions.cc (sigExeced): New global variable.

By moving the definition to globals.cc, we get its extern declaration in
the autogenerated globals.h -- which everybody includes via winsup.h.
