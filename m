I'm not sure why you're not sure what I meant:

Content-Type: text/html; name="stackdump.sgml-patch"
Content-Description: stackdump.sgml-patch
Content-Disposition: inline; filename="stackdump.sgml-patch"

When I looked at this in my email client, it was pretty much illegible.
If I look at it in a text editor (now why didn't I think of that
before?) it looked like a regular patch.

The way that you were sending patches previously was just fine.  I
don't know why you changed it.  Or, maybe your email client did it
for you when it saw the sgml extension.
