Patch applied, with a minor change to fhandler_console.cc and some
reformatting of the ChangeLog.

A ChangeLog entry should list the file name once with just the functions
listed below it.  The entries should also be present tense as in "Fix problem
with foo" rather than "Fixed problem with foo".

Anyway, thanks for the patch.  I've wanted something like this for a long
time.
