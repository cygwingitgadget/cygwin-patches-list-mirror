Naaah.  Don't think in terms of worthiness.  Even a one liner patch which
fixes some bug can be very valuable while some incredible new feature
with 1000s of lines of code could be useless.  Just be prepared that you
might have to defend and/or tweak your patch to be applied.  Or that it
takes time.  That's life.  Just don't be touchy.

Btw., did you already subscribe to cygwin-patches?  If so I'd just send
further mails only to the list and not Cc you.

Oh and, welcome as a new contributor!
