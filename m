What is done is not clearing the screen, but redrawing the screen
based on the screen buffer. This is done not by cmd.exe but by pseudo
console, I believe. The trigger for redrawing is not clear to me.

You can see what is done by pseudo console by checking "typescript"
generated by script.

I confirmed the dwSize has right screen size and dwCursorPosition
is (0,0) just after creating pty even though the cursor position
in real screen is not at top left.

Clearing screen fixes this mismatch.

To do this, it is necessary to log past data written to pty and
push them into console screen buffer when pseudo console is started.

The console screen buffer is empty just after creating pseudo console,
therefore, clearing screen is the simplest way to match the real screen
with the console screen buffer.
