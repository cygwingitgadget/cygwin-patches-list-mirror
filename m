I'm not certain either. I have no experience programming for windows.

The docs for ReadFile/WriteFile did not even indicate that 
ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED was a valid return code. The idea of access failure 
makes more sense for open or create.

I have no idea what else could cause it. But I suspect there are no cases 
where write returns EACCES under POSIX.
