Please look at the "Contributing" link on the Cygwin web page.  I've gone
to some pains to update it lately by showing examples of common problems
with patch submissions.  Unfortunately, there were several problems with
this submission.

I can't comment on the validity of the patch itself.  I hope that Egor
or Kazuhiro will do that.

In the meantime, however, please check out that page.  If you could send
an assignment form, too, that would help make sure that the legalities are
covered.
