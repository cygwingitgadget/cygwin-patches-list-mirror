As I posted in the cygwin mailing list, I see no reason for this patch
or for any of the whines that surrounded it.

Maybe it's just me, but when something like a change to cygpath happens
in software that I support, I just adapt the software that I support,
usually making it more robust in the process.

I realize that this is an open source project, of course, but that
doesn't mean that we have to make a utility into a swiss army knife when
there are plenty of other ways to get the job done with the existing
knives, forks, spoons, etc.
