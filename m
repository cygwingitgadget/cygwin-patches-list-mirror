Good to hear. I'm working on it (I got a conflict when I did cvs update).
Also, I am writing a small test application for /dev/dsp, which might be
added to the winsup testsuite. (And while doing that, I stumbled
accross some flaws I want to fix). 

It shouldn't take too long until I submit my next patch.

Gerd
