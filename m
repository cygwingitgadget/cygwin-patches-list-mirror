Outlook, hmm, let me guess... ;-).  Yeah, it looks like it wants to put tabs
where I put spaces.  I'll see if I can coax it.  I'll send both the
changelog and the diff as attachments too; well, assuming Outlook is still
able to handle such advanced tasks ;-).

Ok, I had seen entries in the snapshot changelogs that had the time, and I
had already sent the previous patch on the same day.  I'll lose it.
