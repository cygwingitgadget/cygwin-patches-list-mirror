Thanks for the patch, it looks like a nice addition.

However, there's the problem of the copyright assignment.  As described
on the http://cygwin.com/contrib.html page, in the "Before you get
started" section, we can't take non-trivial patches without have a
signed copyright assignment form (http://cygwin.com/assign.txt) in place.

Usually it takes the time to snail-mail the assignment to California,
plus 3 or 4 days.  Sorry for the hassle, but it's legally necessary.

Open the console properties dialog and disable QuickEdit.

For backward compatibility, I'd prefer if ESC[9m would still do the same.
As long as ESC[9m isn't desparately needed for something else...

Aren't they compatible with xterm?  I don't think it's a terrible good
idea to change that.

How do you enter any of the control chars ^^, ^\, ^[, ^], ^_ anyway?
In a CMD window using an english keyboard I can just enter any of them
using the control char,  C+S+6 = ^^, C+\ = ^\, C+[ = ^[, C+] = ^],
and C+S+- = ^_.  Same in a cygwin console.  The reason is that these
sequences return their ASCII value in the INPUT_RECORD in
Event.KeyEvent.uChar.

Except for one of them, this doesn't work with a german keyboard and
german keyboard layout.  In this case, the respective keysequences
C+^, C+AltGr+sz, C+AG+8, C+AG+9 return nothing at all.  Only the
C+S+- key returns ^_, as expected.

Alt is converted to a leading ESC.  I don't know how to fix that for
non-ASCII chars, yet.

This needs some more debugging, I guess.
