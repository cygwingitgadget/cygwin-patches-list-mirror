It's in the envelope.

I had checked the properties and nothing worked. QuickEdit enabled would 
disable mouse control for applications altogether; it is disabled so 
mouse click and move events can be processed but the mouse wheel still 
scrolls the window instead, on that machine.

I thought there might be this objection as it is in theory an 
incompatible change but it's not in practice since dim mode doesn't work 
anyway; so I think this change towards the standard assignment should be 
done before someone in the future may fix dim mode to work after which 
it would actually be an incompatible change.

No, they are not:

Linux console
F1..F12         ^[[[A ^[[[B ^[[[C ^[[[D ^[[[E ^[[17~ ^[[18~ ^[[19~ 
^[[20~ ^[[21~ ^[[23~ ^[[24~
shift-F1..F8    ^[[25~ ^[[26~ ^[[28~ ^[[29~ ^[[31~ ^[[32~ ^[[33~ ^[[34~

cygwin console
F1..F12         ^[[[A ^[[[B ^[[[C ^[[[D ^[[[E ^[[17~ ^[[18~ ^[[19~ 
^[[20~ ^[[21~ ^[[23~ ^[[24~
shift-F1..F10   ^[[23~ ^[[24~ ^[[25~ ^[[26~ ^[[28~ ^[[29~ ^[[31~ ^[[32~ 
^[[33~ ^[[34~

xterm, mintty
F1..F12         ^[OP ^[OQ ^[OR ^[OS ^[[15~ ^[[17~ ^[[18~ ^[[19~ ^[[20~ 
^[[21~ ^[[23~ ^[[24~
shift-F1..F12   ^[[1;2P ^[[1;2Q ^[[1;2R ^[[1;2S ^[[15;2~ ^[[17;2~ 
^[[18;2~ ^[[19;2~ ^[[20;2~ ^[[21;2~ ^[[23;2~ ^[[24;2~

Note the shift by 2 in the shifted F-keys from Linux console to cygwin 
console which is quite confusing for any application that might want to 
use them. Modified F-keys are indicated in a generic way by xterm and 
mintty which is much more obvious for unique mapping to the keys and 
which can be detected by applications in a generic way as well. 
Furthermore, xterm and mintty also support Control- and Alt-modified 
F-keys and combinations of the modifiers.
So if your preference would be to follow xterm here anyway, I would 
welcome this change and provide a patch; I think this change can be done 
without compatibility trouble in "mainstream applications" since the 
shifted F-keys are not listed in the cygwin terminfo entry.

Thanks Andy for pointing to the part of mintty code handling this. 
However, the whole function there looks too complex for a quick 
copy-paste-patch. Maybe later... or Andy might like to factor out the 
mapping part in a way directly reusable for the cygwin console? (Or 
should it be left as is because it's "just the console"...?)

For non-ASCII it works fine, thanks to Andy for clarifying; I could have 
checked this myself, even within bash, by simply typing Control-V Alt-รถ. 
It does not work however, even for ASCII characters, for characters 
produced with AltGr, e.g. Alt-AltGr-Q where AltGr-Q is @ (German 
keyboard). Andy got this to work in mintty (I think with some other 
subtle trick after I challenged him for it IIRC); it does not work in 
xterm either.

Do you have an opinion about my theory that the wrong read-ahead buffer 
is being filled here (stdout vs. stdin)? If so, I still have no clue how 
to proceed; maybe you'd kindly give a hint how to access the stdin 
buffer / stdin fhandler?

Thanks,
Thomas
