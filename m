No, that's no problem.  The names on disk are actually just 255 chars
long, so the Linux kernel will handle them just fine.  It's only Cygwin
which should expose 260 chars to user space to emulate the "user."

Yes, it is wrong, because the value of MAX_EA_NAME_LEN / XATTR_NAME_MAX
is used for array size definitions as well as comparisons.

No worries, we're in no hurry.
