Since there isn't any contradiction in the cygwin license that isn't
really an issue.  The FAQ is not the definitive source of all knowledge
about Cygwin.

Btw, the "other license" provision in the cygwin licensing web page was
really meant as a way to accommodate other, already existing projects.
It wasn't intended to allow people to say "Hmm.  My cygwin program is
done.  Now I wonder what kind of open source license I should use".  There
is nothing in the language to preclude this usage, however.
