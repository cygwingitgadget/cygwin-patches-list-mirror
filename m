Chris,

Ooops, sorry about that!  I meant to fill it in after I finished and had 
a chance to look up his name, but I guess I forgot.  Anyhow, according 
the the spec's ChangeLog, the author is Nalin Dahyabhai <nalin at rh 
com>.  This name is also consistant with the RCSId that appears in the 
header comments of flock.c.

Cheers,
Nicholas
