Is there any way around this?  It sounds like a bug.

Unfortunately, the worst case scenario is that clueless newbies flood
the cygwin list with complaints that the setup program didn't work,
when the real problem is that they didn't think about those
selections.  I'm much more concerned with people getting it right the
first time, than with convenience.  Making them stop and think at
those spots makes sense in that case.
