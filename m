Nevermind.  I just remembered a previous discussion with Mumit Khan about a
similar subject.  The reason why the number is good is that the text will
be translated into your native language.

So, when someone in the cygwin mailing list reports a mkpasswd error in
Swahili, the only way I'll be able to figure it out will be from the number.

Objection withdrawn.
