Sorry but this is not a list for random patches to packages.
This is a list for submitting patches to the Cygwin DLL and the other
components of the "winsup" directory (if you aren't sure what this
means, then you shouldn't be sending email here).

Please use the main cygwin list for this type of thing.

See: http://cygwin.com/lists.html .
