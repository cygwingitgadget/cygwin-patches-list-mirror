I got the reply to the assignment form last week.  Thanks for the
T-shirt, I didn't expect that ;-)


I checked the CVS source and noticed that my patch did not get applied
yet.  Did it just fall between the cracks or are there still problems
with it?

I could update the patch to account for the changes that have occurred
in the CVS source in the meantime.  It would take some days though
until I have the spare time.


so long, benny
