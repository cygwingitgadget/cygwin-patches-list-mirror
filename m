I'd like to voice a small objection to this practice of adding and then 
removing symbols, especially given the quantity in this case and the 
period of time which lapsed inbetween.  I don't think this practice 
should be encouraged at all because it can be quite a PITA if you have 
apps which were compiled when the symbols were exported.  I think this 
goes double for "cosmetic" issues which are going to be fixed anyhow in 
the near future.  I'm trying to help Conrad test the cygserver, so I 
have many apps I'm using for testing purposes.  I am now going to have 
to recompile the ones I just compiled the other day due to this change. 
 Chuck once told me, and I agree, that once symbols are added then they 
should not be removed [unless this is done in a very short period of 
time, like a matter of hours].  Any problems which arise with the 
exported function will have to be fixed in due course of time, but the 
export should remain.  Now I realize these are cvs/snapshot sources, but 
some considieration should be given to the consistancy of the dll.  As 
Chuck said, we shouldn't just add[remove] symbols in a willy-nilly 
fashion.  At the very least, if removing the functions *had* to be done, 
you could have left dummy stubs in place until the real functions were 
ready to go.  I guess this is just my 2Â¢ chiming in on this, so feel 
free to disagree...

Cheers,
Nicholas
