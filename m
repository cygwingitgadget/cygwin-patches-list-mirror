Weird.  It works for me.  Andy seems to be right about drivers.

Ooookey, if they aren't listed in terminfo anyway, I have no problems
to change them.  But we should stick to following the Linux console,
I guess.

No copy-paste, please.  Mintty is under GPL, so we can't just take
the code, unless Andy gives us explicit permission to do so.

Well, it works in some way.  I played around with ToUnicode over the
weekend, and I didn't get it working as expected.  Take, for instance,
this (simplified):

  if (input_rec.Event.KeyEvent.dwControlKeyState
      & (LEFT_CTRL_PRESSED | RIGHT_CTRL_PRESSED))
    {
      GetKeyboardState (state);
      state[VK_CONTROL] = state[VK_LCONTROL] = state[VK_RCONTROL] = 0;
      if (ToUnicode (input_rec.Event.KeyEvent.wVirtualKeyCode,
		     input_rec.Event.KeyEvent.wVirtualScanCode,
		     state, wcbuf, 8, 0) > 0)
      	switch (wcbuf[0])
	  {
	  case L'[' ... L'_':
	    got_one = true;
	    break;
	  [...]
	  }
      [...]

When I pressed Strg-^ on a german keyboard layout (left of the "1"
key), I constantly got Ctrl-\ instead of Ctrl-^.  Weird.

Erm... sorry, but do we really talk about the same?  If you press
Alt-รถ, the console generates the sequence ESC 0xc3 0xb6.  That's not
desired so I'm contemplating the idea to skip the keypress if the
resulting multibyte char is > 1 byte.  This restricts ESC-somekey
either to explicit function key sequences (ESC-[-foo, etc), or
to just two byte sequences like ESC-A, ESC-0, ESC-;, etc.

That's potentially too tricky for the current code.  And, whatever
super-duper change we make to this essential console code in future,
let's wait until after 1.7.1, please.

I have no opinion yet, since I don't know this part of the code good
enough.  IIUC you think that the readahead buffer of the wrong
fhandle_console is filled, the one connected with stdout, not the
one connected with stdin, right?
