Or has read any cygwin list for any length of time.

(BTW, I for one could never have predicted your knee-jerk passive-aggressive
reaction to a perfectly accurate statement there.  Touche.)

True enough.

Or, subjected to a bunch of abuse from you.  Brian clearly indicated that he
didn't know whether he had a "simple test case" (I assume typing
'..whatever' is simple enough) or a "vague bug" which as you indicate would
at best have been ignored.  Clearly he:

1.  Knew that "I have a vague bug and don't have time to investigate it, but
this seems to cause it" would almost certainly result in exactly the kind of
BS you simultaneously deny exists and dispense with abandon in your post
(why heck, a simple 'Thank you!' does that!).
2.  Already had his Recommended Daily Allowance of BS, and wasn't all that
hungry for more.

Look me in the eye and tell me my cause-and-effect analysis in #1 is
incorrect Chris.

In fact, there is no cygwin bug-reporting list, such as a "cygwin-bugs@".
Gcc has one (well, a bugzilla-fed list, but still) (DISCLAIMER: This
observation is not to be construed as a demand for anybody, especially
Chris, to do anything).  But where does -developers@ come into play here?  I
apologize, perhaps I haven't been paying very close attention, so feel free
to let it fly Chris.  Get it all out of your system, at least for another
month or so.

Also true enough.

Well, since IIRC Brian's made quite a few valuable donations, here's hoping
he isn't as outraged by your abuse as by rights he should be.

Matter of fact, you will have "shame" heaped upon you if you do that.  Even
more matter-of-factly, you'll have "shame" heaped upon you if you're
*ignored* as well!  As a matter of fact, one would seem to be forced to
conclude that (dare I say it?)... you can't win here.

And there's no need to worry about how much attention I've been paying.

God you are a piece of work Faylor.  What caused all these problems you
suffer from, this hatred of your fellow man?  Or do you just have absolutely
*zero* people-skills and don't even know what your typing?  Or what?  What's
wrong Chris?  Maybe we can debug *you*, and reap the benefits of your
work[1] without having to endure the BS.  Help us help you, Chris.

Help us, help you.
