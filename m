Not to be a pain about this - but this have been reported several times in the 
past and I am running Win2000 and have the W32api-1.3-2 installed.  I haven't 
seen any other w32api come down the pike so that appears to be the most recent. 
I have the patch - just took it out and no compile - put it back and it does 
compile.

Not sure what Mike's OS or yours Robert or if it even makes a difference but I 
thought I would point out mine is Win2k.  I also have my just updated my CVS 
for cinstall so it is current.

I know this is a me2 but I thought I would add what I could.

Bk
