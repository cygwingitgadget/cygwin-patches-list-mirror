Hi,

I have sent in a couple of notes to cygwin-info@redhat.com about
an intellectual rights exception, and i have heard nothing back.  Is
anyone monitoring that email address, and if so, can I get a status?
(I've got this patch in limbo, and want to know whether to just drop
it, or wait a little longer)

Thanks.
