(Also replied to in cygwin@cygwin.com)
From /usr/doc/Cygwin/cygwin-doc-1.3-2.README :
-------------
The two intro pages (intro.1 and intro.3) were written by hand by me.
The rest of the cygwin man pages are autogenerated from the SGML files
found in CVS. 
-------------

Expect a refresh of cygwin-doc (relatively) soon.
