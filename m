Hi Corinna,

Great news!

Yes, I am german and employed by a german company in Germany.
So the employer's signature is not needed? Then all the paperwork should be completed now.
I'll be happy to see my contribution appear in the cygwin distribution.

By the way, I am still working on that audio recording patch: Some code cleanup, and
resolving the issues that I mentioned in the patch I posted. So could you wait for an updated
patch before checking it into the CVS?

Gerd

sometimes it takes a bit time until we get the information.

Are you German (t-online.de address)?  According to German copyright
law, you don't have to ask the employer for signing that stuff as long
as you're working on Cygwin only in your spare time.
