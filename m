Sorry but you seem to misunderstand.  We all are working voluntarily
on Cygwin, all in our spare time.  Nobody here gets money for working
on Cygwin, not even the Red Hat employees.  However, since Cygwin uses
a special licensing, it's required that you send a copyright assignment
form to Red Hat.  We all had to do this at one point.  Your patch can't
get incorporated into Cygwin unless you send that subscribed assignment
form which you can print out from that web page.  Just the money for a
snail mail to USA and a bit of patience is required. 

So you don't send your *patch*, just that form.  For the patch, this
mailing list is the right way to send it.

I'm just trying to make as much as possible from it ;-)
